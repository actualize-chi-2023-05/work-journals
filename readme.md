# Work Journals

### The "What" and the "Why"
> Welcome to the world of 'work journals', a powerful tool for coding enthusiasts and professionals alike. Work journals provide a dedicated space to showcase your passion for coding and document your journey in the programming world. Your journal serves as a repository of your successes, learnings, and challenges faced along the way, allowing you to reflect on your growth and accomplishments over time. By keeping a comprehensive record of your coding projects and achievements, these work journals not only serve as a personal archive but ALSO help you stand out in the competitive industry, demonstrating your dedication and commitment to learning, and your awesome personality.

> In your work journal, you can capture the essence of your coding adventures. You can record the projects you have worked on, the new programming languages or frameworks you have mastered, and the innovative solutions you have developed. By documenting your successes, you can showcase your expertise to potential employers and fellow coders. You can think of it like a [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) Moreover, work journals become a valuable resource for self-reflection, allowing you to see your incredible growth over time, identify areas for further study, and track your awesome progress. 

### What a Work Journal is NOT
> It’s NOT a diary! Your work journal is for showcasing your learnings and enthusiasm, and at times your challenges, but it's not a place to complain or vent. There should be a target audience for your work journal: hiring managers. Help them to better understand your learning process and what you are enthusiastic about. We're not saying "never be negative" - we all face chanllenges in code and in life, right? But it's far, far more interesting to hear about how you persevered when faced with the challenge, rather than an angry diatribe. To reiterate: This is NOT a diary!
