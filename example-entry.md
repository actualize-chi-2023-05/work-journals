### Learnings
_(Describe your learning accomplishments and wins, as well as how you are planning to improve in specific areas)_

I tried Phaser.js for the first time today! It was difficult to get everything installed, as it required setting up a local web server to get started. It took a while to get through the getting started guide, but in the end I was able to work through most of the tutorial and get a simple game up and running! Once I complete the tutorial, I will look at some other examples and try to add a few new features.

If you have Python 2 installed, you can run a simple local web server by running the command:
```Python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

This is useful for working with a local html file that needs access to other files. If you open an html file locally without a server, there are security vulnerabilities with JavaScript access to all the files on the system.
If you want to use Ruby instead, this command will work:
```ruby -run -e httpd . -p 9090```

You‚Äôll need to have the webrick gem installed, if you don‚Äôt then there will be a message in the terminal saying you need to install it with `gem install webrick`. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3108395/serve-current-directory-from-command-line)
