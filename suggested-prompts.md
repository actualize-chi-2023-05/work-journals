# Suggested Prompts for Work Journals

### General Prompts:
- What is something you struggled with (in the last day/week/two weeks) that has since gotten easier or made more sense? What did you do/practice/learn to make that difference?

- What's something you were really excited to learn about this week?
- What's something that you wished we covered in the bootcamp but don't? (because you've already asked your Lead Instructor) Do you wish we covered it because it feels useful, or really interesting, or both?
- Are there any other resources you're using outside of class to learn about coding or the tech industry (podcasts, YouTube, blogs, coding communities/meetup groups, following anyone on Twitter, etc.)? What do you find helpful from those resources?
- Write a TIL (Today I Learned) statement, with enough detail that it would allow someone else to learn it too who doesn't already know it
- Explain a programming meme that now makes sense to you because of something you learned this week.
- Find a developer on Twitter, LinkedIn, or some other platform to follow and/or connect with and write why they're interesting to you (ideas for ways they can be interesting: identity [race, gender, sexuality, age, educational/coding background, disability, religion, etc.], projects they're working on, what they talk about online [languages/frameworks they work in, tech topics they know about, inspirational advice for new devs, etc.]
- Find an article about a tech topic that you understand in a different way than you would have a few weeks ago, because of what you've learned in the bootcamp. What's that different way, and why is that article interesting to you?
- What kind of encouragement or feedback would you most like to hear from your manager at your first job? Be specific.
- When and how did you get help on something this week - outline what that looked like:
    - Where did you get stuck?
    - Which of the 4Ds did you use (Deliberate Practice, Decomposition, Discovery, Debugging)
    - If you needed help from a person, who did you go to? (A classmate, TA, lead instructor, someone you know outside of class who's helping you with coding?)
    - Were you able to get a solution? What was it?

- What dvice you would give to your past self or another person learning this material?
    - Advice on deliberate practice
    - Advice on debugging
    - Advice on decomposition
    - Advice on discovery
    - Advice on managing your work/life balance


### Team Projects:
- What worked well within your team for the Team API project? What didn't work so well? What would you have liked to do differently?

- What went smoothly with working *between* teams with the Team API project? Where did you run into challenges? How did you solve those challenges?

### Capstone:
- How did you decide on your project? How did you decide on the features of the MVP? What do you want to include that maybe you don't have the time or skills for (yet)?

- How did you create your schema, wireframes, associations, and models? (LT: this might need to be refined...I might be just throwing vocab words in a sentence.)
- Describe a problem that came up when building your project, and describe the solution you found for it (and how you found the solution).
- What would you change about your development process for your next project that you learned from building your Capstone?

### End of the cohort:
- What big takeaways do you have from your time at Actualize? 

- What were some of the most impactful resources, exercises, and lessons for you? What were some of the least impactful?
- What are some of the skills you have developed here that you feel will be most beneficial for you as you navigate your career?
